-- look at article to make it csv
-- see if writing all the commands in here and running it will get it done at once?
-- like write down the header and other stuff and change the output file and the command and try it
-- before just doing it over and over in the terminal

-- and some sql data exploration commands like finding amount of jobs in NY with salary over 100k low end
-- use this file for exploration
-- id say get a cont for how many jobs have actual salaries (dont have none for low and high end)
-- how many are over or under a certain threshhold, where they are, and what jobs they are
-- also try to get top 5 key words of each job in each city

-- also work on readme
